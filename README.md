## Design

### Record View

TABLE 1 - Record View States

| Tap to Record | Recording... | Recording Paused... |
| :---:         | :---:        | :---:               |
| ![Tap to Record View](./Paperwork/images/TapToRecordView.png) | ![Recording View](./Paperwork/images/RecordingView.png) | ![Recording Paused View](./Paperwork/images/RecordingPausedView.png) |

TABLE 2 - Recording Control Buttons

| Resume | Pause | Stop  |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| ![Resume Button](./Paperwork/images/ResumeButton_30.png) | ![Pause Button](./Paperwork/images/PauseButton_30.png) | ![Stop Button](./Paperwork/images/StopButton_30.png) |

* The Record View is the initial view after app launch (TABLE 1 - **Tap to Record**).<br/><br/>
* Tap the active microphone icon to start recording:  
  - The view transitions to look like TABLE 1 - **Recording...**
  - Icons that are "greyed out" are inactive and will not respond to a tap<br/><br/>
* While recording, tap the **Pause** button to pause recording:
  - The view transitions to look like TABLE 1 - **Recording Paused...**
  - Resume button becomes active, pause/stop buttons become inactive.<br/><br/>
* While recording, tap the **Stop** button to stop recording:
  - Recording function is terminated
  - The view transitions to the Playback View.<br/><br/>
* While recording is paused, tap the **Resume** button to continue recording:
  - New audio will be appended to previously recorded audio
  - Resume button becomes inactive, pause/stop buttons become active.<br/><br/>

### Playback View

TABLE 3 - Playback View

| Play                                      | 
| :---:                           |                      
| ![Playback View](./Paperwork/images/PlayView.png) |

TABLE 4 - Playback Effects Buttons

| Snail  | Rabbit | Chipmunk | Darth Vader | Hawk  | Reverb |
| :---:  | :---:  | :---:    | :---:       | :---: | :---:  | 
| ![Snail Button](./Paperwork/images/SnailButton_50.png) | ![Rabbit Button](./Paperwork/images/RabbitButton_50.png) | ![Chipmunk Button](./Paperwork/images/ChipmunkButton_50.png) | ![Darth Vader Button](./Paperwork/images/DarthVaderButton_50.png) | ![Hawk Button](./Paperwork/images/HawkButton_50.png) | ![Reverb Button](./Paperwork/images/ReverbButton_50.png)

* Tap the **Snail** button to play the original audio at one-half the recording speed, making the audio sound slower.
* Tap the **Rabbit** button to play the original audio at twice the recording speed, making the audio sound faster.
* Tap the **Chipmunk** button to play the original audio with pitch one octave higher than the original, making the audio sound higher.
* Tap the **Darth Vader** button to play the original audio with pitch one octave lower that the original, making the audio sound lower.
* Tap the **Hawk** button to play the original audio with an [echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo) based on a one-second delay.
* Tap the **Reverb** button to play the original audio with a [reverberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation) containing the acoustic characteristics of a medium-sized hall environment, using a [wet-dry mix](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-wet-and-dry-signals-or-sounds/) of 50%.
* During playback, tap the **Stop** button to terminate playback<br/><br/>
* During playback, tap an effect button to terminate the current playback, and restart playback with the new effect.
* At any time, tap the **< Record** button (in the navigation bar) to terminate playback (if active) and return to the **Tap to Record** state of the **Record View**.
