## Design

### Record View

###### TABLE 1 - Record View States
| Tap to Record | Recording... | Recording Paused... |
| :---:         | :---:        | :---:               |
| ![][TRV]      | ![][RV]      | ![][RPV]            |

###### TABLE 2 - Recording Control Buttons
| Resume            | Pause            | Stop            |
| :---:             | :---:            | :---:           |
| ![][ResumeButton] | ![][PauseButton] | ![][StopButton] |

* The **Record View** is the initial view after app launch and looks like **Tap to Record**.<br/><br/>
* Tap the active microphone icon to start recording:  
  - The view transitions to **Recording...**.
  - Icons that are "greyed out" are inactive and will not respond to a tap.<br/><br/>
* While recording, tap the **Pause** button to pause recording:
  - The view transitions to **Recording Paused...**.
  - **Resume** button becomes active, **Pause/Stop** buttons become inactive.<br/><br/>
* While recording, tap the **Stop** button to stop recording:
  - Recording function is terminated.
  - The view transitions to the **Playback View**.<br/><br/>
* While recording is paused, tap the **Resume** button to continue recording:
  - New audio will be appended to previously recorded audio
  - **Resume** button becomes inactive, **Pause/Stop** buttons become active.<br/><br/>

### Playback View

###### TABLE 3 - Playback View
|          | 
| :---:    |                      
| ![][PVC] |

###### TABLE 4 - Playback Effect Buttons
| Snail  | Rabbit | Chipmunk | Darth Vader | Hawk  | Reverb |
| :---:  | :---:  | :---:    | :---:       | :---: | :---:  | 
| ![][SnailButton] | ![][RabbitButton] | ![][ChipmunkButton] | ![][DarthVaderButton] | ![][HawkButton] | ![][ReverbButton] |

* Tap the **Snail** button to play the original audio at one-half the recording speed, *making the audio sound slower*.
* Tap the **Rabbit** button to play the original audio at twice the recording speed, *making the audio sound faster*.
* Tap the **Chipmunk** button to play the original audio with pitch one octave higher than the original, *making the audio sound higher*.
* Tap the **Darth Vader** button to play the original audio with pitch one octave lower that the original, *making the audio sound lower*.
* Tap the **Hawk** button to play the original audio with *an [echo][Echo] based on a one-second delay*.
* Tap the **Reverb** button to play the original audio with *a [reverberation][Reverberation] containing the acoustic characteristics of a medium-sized hall environment, using a [wet-dry mix][WetDryMix] of 50%*.
* During playback, tap the **Stop** button to terminate playback<br/><br/>
* During playback, tap an effect button to terminate the current playback, and restart playback with the new effect.
* At any time, tap the **< Record** button (in the navigation bar) to terminate playback (if active) and return to the **Tap to Record** state of the **Record View**.
